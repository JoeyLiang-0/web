<p>My 6-grade son doesn’t like writing, but saw he was busying on writing something. So I asked him,</p>

<ul class="dialog">
<li who="me">What are you writing?</li>
<li who="son">An article about ordinal numbers.</li>
<li who="me">???… Anything new from you?</li>
<li who="son">Not really, but the existing articles online I found are hard to understand, so I’m writing a longer version with examples to help more people to understand it.</li>
<li who="me">Even me?</li>
<li who="son">Maybe. I’m sending the link to you so you can try. And, any comments are welcome.</li>

<p>

<i>(several minutes later...)</i>
</p>

<li who="me">Read your articles couple times, I can only understood the 1st paragraph and the last section.<br>
(Note: The 1st paragraph is introduction, the last section is ‘references’)</li>
<li who="son">Great! At least you can understand some, I’m very proud of you!</li>
</ul>
