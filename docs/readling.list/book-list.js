                description: `In How Charts Lie, data visualization expert Alberto Cairo teaches us to not only spot the lies in
                    deceptive visuals, but also to take advantage of good ones to understand complex stories. Public
                    conversations are increasingly propelled by numbers, and to make sense of them we must be able
                    to decode and use visual information. By examining contemporary examples ranging from
                    election-result infographics to global GDP maps and box-office record charts, How Charts Lie
                    demystifies an essential new literacy, one that will make us better equipped to navigate our datadriven
                    world.`
